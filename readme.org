#+TITLE company-mode ESS completion backend

This a tentative support for ESS completion for company-mode, based on the same code used in =ess-r-d.el= for auto-complete.

* Features
  - Complete R objects/args based on =.ess_get_completions= functions defined by ESS
  - Support for company-mode powered documentation using the =F1= key
  - Support for object annotations using R's =typeof= function. (truncated to 3 first character)

* Issues
  - Moving between candidates using =M-n= and =M-p= is very slow compared to =company-elisp= (for example)
  - objects that contains spaces will show annotation as =nil=. The completion engine return the list of completion without =''=.
  - Documentation buffer comes with a list of shortcuts (?)

* Usage 
  1. Download
  2. Run:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'company-ess)
#+END_SRC
