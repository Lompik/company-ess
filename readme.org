#+TITLE: company-mode ESS completion backend

This a tentative support for ESS completion for company-mode, based on the same code used in =ess-r-d.el= for auto-complete.

* Note
Recent version of ess (i.e. > 15.03) has built-in company-mode support. I have switched to use its backend instead. I also removed this package from [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa/pull/2775][melpa]] to avoid confusion.

* Features
  - Complete R objects/args based on =.ess_get_completions= functions defined by ESS

  - Support for company-mode powered documentation using the =F1= key
  - [Disabled] Support for object annotations using R's =typeof= function. (truncated to 3 first character). Moving between candidates using =M-n= and =M-p= is very slow as =company-mode= calls the annotation function each movement.

* Issues
  - objects that contains spaces will show annotation as =nil=. The completion engine return the list of completion without =''=.
  - Documentation buffer comes ESS .. with a list of shortcuts

* Usage 
  1. Download
     - Currently in the process of creating a MELPA package 
  2. Run:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'company-ess)

; Enabling the backend :
; Globally - company ess-backend checks ess mode 
(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-ess-backend)

; OR locally to ess mode
;(add-hook 'ess-mode-hook (lambda ()
;                          (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends) '(company-ess))
;                          (company-mode)))
